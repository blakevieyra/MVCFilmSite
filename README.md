# MVCFilmSite
# Description
- To initialize this project, download the files in the MVCFilmProject directory and run it on your server.

The user also can create a new film by entering the appropriate parameters and following the prompts.

# Technologies Used
- The technologies used in the project include SpringToolSuites4 IDE, Java, SQL, Gradle and Tomcat. 

# Lessons Learned
- MVCFilmSite is our first full-stack project in a group, we learned the importance of having a good plan before we begin and dividing up the tasks first. We also made it so we were not working on the same code at the same time, to prevent coding overlap and have meetings as needed to discuss changes or key decision points.
